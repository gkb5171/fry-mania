# fry-mania
My first ever coding project, assigned and created senior year of high school.

This is a Endless Arcade Style game based off of my first job. French Fries will constantly fall from above into the fryer oil on the bottom. Your goal is to catch as many
fries as possible in the fryer basket. If you miss a fry you will lose health because fryer oil splashed on you. The higher your score the faster the fries will fall.
There are numerous power ups to aid in getting a highscore. Please look at the how to play option on the main menu. 

NOTE: I aim to go back and make the highscores save once I have more free time and graduate from college.
